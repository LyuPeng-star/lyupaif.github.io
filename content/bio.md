collaborationEmailSubject: "Research Collaboration Opportunity - AI Interpretability"
collaborationEmailBody: "Dear Dr. Lyu,

Greetings! I hope this email finds you well.

I recently came across your research work through your academic website and was particularly impressed by your contributions to AI interpretability and neural architecture design.

I am reaching out to explore potential collaboration opportunities in:

□ AI interpretability research

□ Joint publication projects

□ Student exchange programs

□ Grant application collaborations

Your work on [specific research area] aligns closely with my research interests, and I believe there could be significant synergies between our work.

Would you be available for a brief discussion in the coming weeks? I would be happy to share more details about my research background and discuss potential collaboration directions.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Please add your name, affiliation, and contact information]"

# About Me

I am a PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at Jeonju University, South Korea, with a deep passion for making AI systems more transparent, interpretable, and efficient. My research focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence and human cognition, aiming to bridge the gap between complex AI models and human understanding.

## Research Philosophy

I believe that the future of AI lies not just in creating more powerful models, but in developing systems that humans can understand, trust, and effectively collaborate with. My work contributes to this vision through developing interpretable neural architectures and intelligent sensing systems.

## Current Projects

- **Interpretable Neural Architecture Search**: Developing automated methods to design neural networks that are both efficient and explainable
- **Intelligent Sensing for Robotics**: Creating adaptive perception systems for autonomous robots
- **Cross-cultural AI Applications**: Exploring AI applications in Korean industrial contexts
